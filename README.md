# Vision-Unlocked-A-dive-into-OpenCV
This project showcases real-time object detection using YOLOv8 integrated with OpenCV. It uses pre-trained YOLO weights for detecting objects like pedestrians and vehicles in images/videos/Webcam. OpenCV processes video feeds and displays results with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores, ensuring speed and accuracy.
